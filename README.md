# JSSG

Jorde's static site generator, there's some stuff I want to do like
reference gurbani from https://gurbaninow.com in text in blog posts
and I figured I might as well write a basic SSG and learn some more C
in the process as well as automating site generation of my website.

## Usage 

Set the `JSSG_HEADER`, `JSSG_FOOTER`, `JSSG_INDEX` and
`JSSG_ARTICLES` environment variables appropriately and then just run.
